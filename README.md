# 05-FPS-Maze
4/11/23

This is the fifth project for my Game Technology Course. For this project I created a basic FPS maze game.
In this game, the goal is to traverse the maze in search for a magical flower that will unlock the exit and allow you to escape the maze.

## Implementation

Built using Godot 3.5

## References

- I used the Rock 035 (https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Rock035) and Grass 003 (https://ambientcg.com/view?id=Grass003) textures from ambientCG for the ground and walls of the maze.

- The music I used for the game is "Interpretación de una Fantasía" which can be found on (https://patrickdearteaga.com/royalty-free-music/full-list/)

- For the 3d flower and watermelon icon in the minimap I used the Nature Kit from Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/nature-kit) 

- For the minimap tile icons I used the Road Textures pack from Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/road-textures)

- For the flower collecting sound effect I used sqeeeek_bell_ting2.wav by sqeeeek on (https://freesound.org/people/sqeeeek/sounds/237105/)

- For my game menus I used the Stars shader by gerardogc2378 on (https://godotshaders.com/shader/stars-shader/)

- For my world environment I used the Dikhololo Night HDR image by Greg Zaal on (https://polyhaven.com/a/dikhololo_night)

## Future Development

For future developments I would like to add an enemy, a shooting mechanism, and more items to collect around the maze.
